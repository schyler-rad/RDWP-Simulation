# RDWP-Simulation
I wrote this: My agent-type simulation of my business, used for setting prices based on a diverse customer base

I wrote preceeding sentence. AI wrote the rest.

This repository contains a simple simulation model built to support planning and decision-making for Rainy Day Work & Play (RDWP), a mixed-use indoor space offering coworking, tutoring, and play areas for families.

The simulation models customer flow, space utilization, and staffing under different usage scenarios (e.g., weekday mornings, rainy weekends, summer camps). It helps explore capacity limits, bottlenecks, and revenue estimates.

## What's Included

- `rdwp_simulation.R` — core simulation script
- `scenarios/` — pre-built usage scenarios
- `outputs/` — example visualizations and summaries
- `README.md` — this file

## Goals

- Support planning decisions about staffing, pricing, and layout
- Identify high-demand time slots and resource constraints
- Inform investment decisions with data
