I wrote preceeding sentence. AI wrote the rest, and it's maybe 60-85% accurate.

# RDWP Operational Simulation

This repository contains a stochastic simulation model designed to support planning and pricing decisions for Rainy Day Work & Play (RDWP), a mixed-use indoor space offering coworking, tutoring, and play areas for families.

The model simulates aggregate customer usage across time, space, and service areas under different demand and scheduling assumptions. It provides evidence to support pricing and operational decision-making.

## What's Included

- `my_sim_script.R` — main script to run the simulation
- Other `.R` files — support functions and parameter definitions

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo.
2. Open R and source all scripts.
3. Run `my_sim_script.R` to generate simulation output.

## Purpose

- Explore impacts of pricing and scheduling strategies
- Support decision-making with probabilistic evidence
- Stress-test operational assumptions for launch scenarios
